# Zoopla Developer test
Here is my take on the Zoopla Developer test

## Personal notes
I spent about 12-14 hours on this total.  This was largely due to me choosing to try 
out a new framework - Next JS.  It was not the right tool for this job, as it turned 
out but I wanted to try to as I was considering using it for my personal site.

### Tests
Tests could improve slightly but I don't want this sucking up more time.  Variations 
of submissions are put through the Results page, which cover most logical routes.

### Other notes
This probably should have been done in either vanilla ES6 or with a simple React app 
and Express handling the routing.
